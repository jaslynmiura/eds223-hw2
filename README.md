# The Legacy of Redlining in Los Angeles County

This is a GitHub repository for Jaslyn Miura's analysis of the effects of redlining's legacy on modern day Los Angeles County and the bird biodiversity within the county, using EJScreen, HOLC Redlining, and Biodiversity observation data.

To understand the redlining's effects on the present day Los Angeles County, a map was created to understand the distribution of redlining grades assigned to different neighborhoods in the county. Bar graphs were produced to then determine the relationship between several environmental justice issues and the proportion of neighborhood grades. A graph was created to understand the proportion of bird observations within each redlining grade.

The eds-hw2 directory contains:

**data**:

-   ejscreen: raw EJscreen data

-   gbif-birds-LA: raw Biodiversity observations data

-   mapping-inequality: raw HOLC Redlining data

**redlining_LA.pdf:** Rendered quarto document with complete code, maps, and analysis.

**redlining_LA.qmd:** Quarto document that creates a map of LA County and bar graphs for analysis.

## **Data Access:**

The EJScreen data was accessed through the EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool website. Numerous EJ indicators are available for all the states in the United States and U.S. Territories. HOLC Redlining data was accessed through the Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America website. Where data is categorized by a redlining grade and is available for cities across the states. The Biodiversity observations data was accessed through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
